# This poc is made to bring terrorists down to the hell which is made via Allah (GOD the creator of this universe) to punish them after their death, beside punishing them during their lifetime by us as civilized societies using the security authorities upon reporting to them which are controlled universally via the ARMY of Allah the creator of this universe till the judgement day (vanishment of the universe) then they'll take a rest ðŸ˜Š in the heaven where they belong but not temporarily for short naps. Note that the intent of this repository is to reuse the information technology theories wisely which are taught via universities worldwide to reduce the cost/wastage as much as we can not on the cost of the human lifes as those terrorists in the industry worldwide are making as I mentioned before.
