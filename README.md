Add useful descriptive info about effectively constructing development process environment [java-backend enterprise level application] so our kids will be safe in the future when they try to reuse the information technology theories which are taught at universities worldwide

# Planned environments ([`profiles`](https://github.com/muhamed-hassan/profiling)) for effective delivery:
1. [`local`](https://github.com/muhamed-hassan/profiling/wiki/Usage#local-profile)
2. [`testing`](https://github.com/muhamed-hassan/profiling/wiki/Usage#testing-profile) ([Virtualization model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtualization) OR [Containerization model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Containerization_(computing)))
3. [`production`](https://github.com/muhamed-hassan/profiling/wiki/Usage#production-profile) ([Virtualization model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtualization) OR [Containerization model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Containerization_(computing)))

This [POC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_of_concept) is made to bring licentious thieves terrorists down to the hell ðŸ”¥ which is made via Allah (GOD the creator of this [universe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universe)) to punish them after their death, beside punishing them during their lifetime by us as [civilized societies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth) using the #security_authorities ðŸ•µ ðŸ‘® ðŸš” ðŸš¨ upon reporting to them which are controlled universally via the ARMY of Allah the creator of this [universe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universe) till the judgement day (vanishment of the universe) then they'll take a rest ðŸ˜Š in the heaven where they belong but not temporarily for short naps.

Note that the **intent of this repository** is to reuse the information technology theories wisely which are taught via universities worldwide to reduce the cost as much as we can not on the cost of the human lifes as those licentious thieves terrorists in the industry worldwide are making as I mentioned before.
