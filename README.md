**Allah** is an `absolute name` that can not be translated in any human language and means the name of GOD the only creator of this universe. We can not fully describe him as creatures because he is the creator and the human language can not describe him well. His miracles as quran, bible, torah and others for his prophets and his creatures were not given to certain people but for all of them. Just remeber that well and recall that mother fucker countryside savage dogs discriminate people because they are disbelievers, they worship animals, idols, and others - besides they believe in the multiplicity of gods. Just read a bit in racism.

The word of **`GOD`** can be translated in any human language as in arabic => الرب أو ربنا .

> Source as a Reference [We don't memorize it mate 😇] from Quran: `( 1 ) Say, "He is Allah, [who is] One, ( 2 ) Allah, the Eternal Refuge. ( 3 ) He neither begets nor is born, ( 4 ) Nor is there to Him any equivalent."` [Sura Al-Ikhlaas - Aya 1 to Aya 4]

> Source as a Reference [We don't memorize it mate 😇] from Quran: `( 29 ) Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah; and those with him are forceful against the disbelievers, merciful among themselves. You see them bowing and prostrating [in prayer], seeking bounty from Allah and [His] pleasure. Their mark is on their faces from the trace of prostration. That is their description in the Torah. And their description in the Gospel is as a plant which produces its offshoots and strengthens them so they grow firm and stand upon their stalks, delighting the sowers - so that Allah may enrage by them the disbelievers. Allah has promised those who believe and do righteous deeds among them forgiveness and a great reward.` [Sura Al-Fath - Aya 29]

> Source as a Reference [We don't memorize it mate 😇] from Quran: `( 40 ) If you do not aid the Prophet - Allah has already aided him when those who disbelieved had driven him out [of Makkah] as one of two, when they were in the cave and he said to his companion, "Do not grieve; indeed Allah is with us." And Allah sent down his tranquillity upon him and supported him with angels you did not see and made the word of those who disbelieved the lowest, while the word of Allah - that is the highest. And Allah is Exalted in Might and Wise.` [Sura At-Tawba - Aya 40]

> Source as a Reference [We don't memorize it mate 😇] from Quran: `( 98 ) [Dhul-Qarnayn] said, "This is a mercy from my Lord; but when the promise of my Lord comes, He will make it level, and ever is the promise of my Lord true." ( 99 ) And We will leave them that day surging over each other, and [then] the Horn will be blown, and We will assemble them in [one] assembly. ( 100 ) And We will present Hell that Day to the Disbelievers, on display - ( 101 ) Those whose eyes had been within a cover [removed] from My remembrance, and they were not able to hear. ( 102 ) Then do those who disbelieve think that they can take My servants instead of Me as allies? Indeed, We have prepared Hell for the disbelievers as a lodging. ( 103 ) Say, [O Muhammad], "Shall we [believers] inform you of the greatest losers as to [their] deeds?
( 104 ) [They are] those whose effort is lost in worldly life, while they think that they are doing well in work." ( 105 ) Those are the ones who disbelieve in the verses of their Lord and in [their] meeting Him, so their deeds have become worthless; and We will not assign to them on the Day of Resurrection any importance. ( 106 ) That is their recompense - Hell - for what they denied and [because] they took My signs and My messengers in ridicule.` [Sura Al-Kahf - Aya 98 to Aya 106]

> Source as a Reference [We don't memorize it mate 😇] from Quran: `( 99 ) [For such is the state of the disbelievers], until, when death comes to one of them, he says, "My Lord, send me back
( 100 ) That I might do righteousness in that which I left behind." No! It is only a word he is saying; and behind them is a barrier until the Day they are resurrected.` [Sura Al-Muminoon - Aya 99 to Aya 100]

> Source as a Reference [We don't memorize it mate 😇] from Quran: `( 6 ) Indeed, those who disbelieve - it is all the same for them whether you warn them or do not warn them - they will not believe. ( 7 ) Allah has set a seal upon their hearts and upon their hearing, and over their vision is a veil. And for them is a great punishment. ( 8 ) And of the people are some who say, "We believe in Allah and the Last Day," but they are not believers. ( 9 ) They [think to] deceive Allah and those who believe, but they deceive not except themselves and perceive [it] not. ( 10 ) In their hearts is disease, so Allah has increased their disease; and for them is a painful punishment because they [habitually] used to lie. ( 11 ) And when it is said to them, "Do not cause corruption on the earth," they say, "We are but reformers." ( 12 ) Unquestionably, it is they who are the corrupters, but they perceive [it] not. ( 13 ) And when it is said to them, "Believe as the people have believed," they say, "Should we believe as the foolish have believed?" Unquestionably, it is they who are the foolish, but they know [it] not. ( 14 ) And when they meet those who believe, they say, "We believe"; but when they are alone with their evil ones, they say, "Indeed, we are with you; we were only mockers." ( 15 ) [But] Allah mocks them and prolongs them in their transgression [while] they wander blindly. ( 16 ) Those are the ones who have purchased error [in exchange] for guidance, so their transaction has brought no profit, nor were they guided.` [Sura Al-Baqara - Aya 6 to Aya 16]

> Source as a Reference [We don't memorize it mate 😇] from Quran: `( 71 ) And those who disbelieved will be driven to Hell in groups until, when they reach it, its gates are opened and its keepers will say, "Did there not come to you messengers from yourselves, reciting to you the verses of your Lord and warning you of the meeting of this Day of yours?" They will say, "Yes, but the word of punishment has come into effect upon the disbelievers. ( 72 ) [To them] it will be said, "Enter the gates of Hell to abide eternally therein, and wretched is the residence of the arrogant."` [Sura Az-Zumar - Aya 71 to Aya 72] 

> Source as a Reference [We don't memorize it mate 😇] from Quran: `( 42 ) And never think that Allah is unaware of what the wrongdoers do. He only delays them for a Day when eyes will stare [in horror]. ( 43 )   Racing ahead, their heads raised up, their glance does not come back to them, and their hearts are void. ( 44 ) And, [O Muhammad], warn the people of a Day when the punishment will come to them and those who did wrong will say, "Our Lord, delay us for a short term; we will answer Your call and follow the messengers." [But it will be said], "Had you not sworn, before, that for you there would be no cessation? ( 45 ) And you lived among the dwellings of those who wronged themselves, and it had become clear to you how We dealt with them. And We presented for you [many] examples." ( 46 ) And they had planned their plan, but with Allah is [recorded] their plan, even if their plan had been [sufficient] to do away with the mountains. ( 47 ) So never think that Allah will fail in His promise to His messengers. Indeed, Allah is Exalted in Might and Owner of Retribution. ( 48 ) [It will be] on the Day the earth will be replaced by another earth, and the heavens [as well], and all creatures will come out before Allah, the One, the Prevailing. ( 49 ) And you will see the criminals that Day bound together in shackles, ( 50 ) Their garments of liquid pitch and their faces covered by the Fire. ( 51 ) So that Allah will recompense every soul for what it earned. Indeed, Allah is swift in account. ( 52 ) This [Qur'an] is notification for the people that they may be warned thereby and that they may know that He is but one God and that those of understanding will be reminded.` [Sura Ibrahim - Aya 42 to Aya 52]

> Source as a Reference [We don't memorize it mate 😇] from Quran: `( 8 ) How [can there be a treaty] while, if they gain dominance over you, they do not observe concerning you any pact of kinship or covenant of protection? They satisfy you with their mouths, but their hearts refuse [compliance], and most of them are defiantly disobedient.` [Sura At-Tawba - Aya 8]

> Source as a Reference [We don't memorize it mate 😇] from Quran: `( 78 ) Wherever you may be, death will overtake you, even if you should be within towers of lofty construction. But if good comes to them, they say, "This is from Allah "; and if evil befalls them, they say, "This is from you." Say, "All [things] are from Allah." So what is [the matter] with those people that they can hardly understand any statement?` [Sura An-Nisaa - Aya 78]

This repository is made to bring licentious thieves terrorists down to the hell 🔥 which is made via Allah (GOD the creator of this [universe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universe)) to punish them after their death, beside punishing them during their lifetime by us as [civilized societies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_population_(United_Nations)) using the #security_authorities 🕵 👮 🚔 🚨 upon reporting to them which are controlled universally via the ARMY of Allah the creator of this [universe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universe) till the judgement day (vanishment of the universe) then they'll take a rest 😊 in the heaven where they belong but not temporarily for short naps.

Note that the **intent of this repository** is to reuse the information technology theories wisely which are taught via universities worldwide to reduce the cost as much as we can not on the cost of the human lifes as those licentious thieves terrorists in the industry worldwide are making as I mentioned before.
