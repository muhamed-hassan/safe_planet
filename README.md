**Allah** is an `absolute name` that can not be translated in any human language and means the name of GOD the only creator of this universe. We can not fully describe him as creatures because he is the creator and the human language can not describe him well. His miracles as quran, bible and others for his prophets and his creatures were not given to certain people but for all of them. Just remeber that well and recall that mother fucker countryside savage dogs discriminate people because they are disbelievers, they worship animals, idols, and others - besides they believe in the multiplicity of gods. Just read a bit in racism.

The word of **`GOD`** can be translated in any human language as in arabic => Ø§Ù„Ø±Ø¨ Ø£Ùˆ Ø±Ø¨Ù†Ø§ .

> Source as a Reference [We don't memorize it mate ðŸ˜‡] from Quran: `( 1 ) Say, "He is Allah, [who is] One, ( 2 ) Allah, the Eternal Refuge. ( 3 ) He neither begets nor is born, ( 4 ) Nor is there to Him any equivalent."` [Sura Al-Ikhlaas - Aya 1 to Aya 4]

> Source as a Reference [We don't memorize it mate ðŸ˜‡] from Quran: `( 29 ) Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah; and those with him are forceful against the disbelievers, merciful among themselves. You see them bowing and prostrating [in prayer], seeking bounty from Allah and [His] pleasure. Their mark is on their faces from the trace of prostration. That is their description in the Torah. And their description in the Gospel is as a plant which produces its offshoots and strengthens them so they grow firm and stand upon their stalks, delighting the sowers - so that Allah may enrage by them the disbelievers. Allah has promised those who believe and do righteous deeds among them forgiveness and a great reward.` [Sura Al-Fath - Aya 29]

> Source as a Reference [We don't memorize it mate ðŸ˜‡] from Quran: `( 40 ) If you do not aid the Prophet - Allah has already aided him when those who disbelieved had driven him out [of Makkah] as one of two, when they were in the cave and he said to his companion, "Do not grieve; indeed Allah is with us." And Allah sent down his tranquillity upon him and supported him with angels you did not see and made the word of those who disbelieved the lowest, while the word of Allah - that is the highest. And Allah is Exalted in Might and Wise.` [Sura At-Tawba - Aya 40]

> Source as a Reference [We don't memorize it mate ðŸ˜‡] from Quran: `( 98 ) [Dhul-Qarnayn] said, "This is a mercy from my Lord; but when the promise of my Lord comes, He will make it level, and ever is the promise of my Lord true." ( 99 ) And We will leave them that day surging over each other, and [then] the Horn will be blown, and We will assemble them in [one] assembly. ( 100 ) And We will present Hell that Day to the Disbelievers, on display - ( 101 ) Those whose eyes had been within a cover [removed] from My remembrance, and they were not able to hear. ( 102 ) Then do those who disbelieve think that they can take My servants instead of Me as allies? Indeed, We have prepared Hell for the disbelievers as a lodging. ( 103 ) Say, [O Muhammad], "Shall we [believers] inform you of the greatest losers as to [their] deeds?
( 104 ) [They are] those whose effort is lost in worldly life, while they think that they are doing well in work." ( 105 ) Those are the ones who disbelieve in the verses of their Lord and in [their] meeting Him, so their deeds have become worthless; and We will not assign to them on the Day of Resurrection any importance. ( 106 ) That is their recompense - Hell - for what they denied and [because] they took My signs and My messengers in ridicule.` [Sura Al-Kahf - Aya 98 to Aya 106]

Add useful descriptive info about effectively constructing development process environment [java-backend enterprise level application] so our kids will be safe in the future when they try to reuse the information technology theories which are taught at universities worldwide

***

# Planned environments ([`profiles`](https://github.com/muhamed-hassan/profiling)) for effective delivery:
1. [`local`](https://github.com/muhamed-hassan/profiling/wiki/Usage#local-profile)
2. [`testing`](https://github.com/muhamed-hassan/profiling/wiki/Usage#testing-profile) ([Virtualization model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtualization) OR [Containerization model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Containerization_(computing)))
3. [`production`](https://github.com/muhamed-hassan/profiling/wiki/Usage#production-profile) ([Virtualization model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtualization) OR [Containerization model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Containerization_(computing)))

This [POC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_of_concept) is made to bring licentious thieves terrorists down to the hell ðŸ”¥ which is made via Allah (GOD the creator of this [universe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universe)) to punish them after their death, beside punishing them during their lifetime by us as [civilized societies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth) using the #security_authorities ðŸ•µ ðŸ‘® ðŸš” ðŸš¨ upon reporting to them which are controlled universally via the ARMY of Allah the creator of this [universe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universe) till the judgement day (vanishment of the universe) then they'll take a rest ðŸ˜Š in the heaven where they belong but not temporarily for short naps.

Note that the **intent of this repository** is to reuse the information technology theories wisely which are taught via universities worldwide to reduce the cost as much as we can not on the cost of the human lifes as those licentious thieves terrorists in the industry worldwide are making as I mentioned before.
